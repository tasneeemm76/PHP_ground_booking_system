Our ground booking system is designed with attention to detail, ensuring a smooth, user-friendly experience for both admins and users. Here’s how it works and the thoughtful features we’ve built into it:

Preventing Past Bookings: To keep the schedule organized and avoid confusion, our system doesn’t allow bookings for past dates. Users can only select current or future dates, helping to prevent mistakes and keeping the calendar up-to-date.

Handling Multiple Requests: With a system that can handle many users at once, we’ve implemented measures to avoid double bookings or errors when multiple people try to reserve a slot at the same time. This ensures that each booking is unique and prevents any overlap.

Filtering and Sorting Bookings: Admins can easily manage bookings using advanced filters. They can view bookings by specific grounds, select particular dates, or even see bookings within certain periods, like the past 10 days or past month. This helps in quickly finding information without manual searching.

Session Management for Security: We use secure sessions to track users who log in, ensuring only authorized individuals can make or manage bookings. Each user’s data is secure, and they can only access their own account information.

Automated Form Updates: For easy booking, as soon as a ground and date are selected, the available time slots automatically load, saving time and making the process smooth.

Dynamic Booking Table: The booking table on the admin dashboard updates automatically based on filter selections. This means admins don’t need to reload the page to see updated booking information—they simply adjust the filters, and the table reflects the current data instantly.

Easy Cancellation and Management: Each booking entry has a delete option for quick cancellations or changes. This allows admins to efficiently manage bookings in real time.

User-Friendly Design: The layout is designed to be intuitive, with booking options on one side of the screen and the booking table on the other. This makes it easy to manage bookings and see all relevant information at a glance.

Overall, our ground booking system is built to be reliable, secure, and efficient, with user-friendly features that streamline the booking process and keep all data safe and well-organized.
